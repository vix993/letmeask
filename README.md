## Motivation

This repository holds a project called [`LetMeAsk`](https://letmeask-it.vercel.app/). In this project, I created a platform in which users can post their questions, for other users to answer or interact with user posts.

You can run it by cloning the repository. Running `cd letmeask`,`yarn install` then executing the command `npm run start`.

## Requirements

Typescript, Firebase, Tailwind Css, and more.
